We propose a general model called Descriptor Generation Model (DGM), which can be used to systematically construct a wide range of HOG-style descriptors for pedestrian detection. Second, Second, based on the DGM, a pedestrian detection experimental framework (PDEF) is introduced to find the optimal HOG-style descriptor. At last, the genetic algorithm is employed to search the optimal (or semi-optimal) HOG-style descriptor in the descriptor space. Finally, And a new descriptor named Second-order Gradient for Pedestrian detection (G2P) is presented. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the G2P descriptor over the standard HOG descriptor. More information please refer to the paper.
