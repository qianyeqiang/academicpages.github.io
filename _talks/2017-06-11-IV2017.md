I make the first oral presentation in the conference. The talk is mainly about the pedestrian detection using a fish-eye camera. I propose a adaptive algorithm to handle the large distortion pedestrian features in fish-eye images. The algorithm is inspired by the Deformable Part Model (DPM), and improves the detection accuracy compared with traditional methods. More information. More information please refer to the paper.
