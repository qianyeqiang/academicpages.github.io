* I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. My supervisor is Prof. Ming Yang. I received the B.S. degree in Automation from Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China, in 2015. 
* My main research topic is mainly about perception in self-driving cars using cameras and lidars. Effective perception, both in accuracy and efficiency, is the basis for safe driving of self-driving cars. I am currently working to optimize perception algorithms in self-driving car using deep learning, including object detection, tracking and prediction. 
* I am currently the leader of laboratory team, I will guide the team to attend Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge (IV 2018) in November 2018, Changshu, Jiangsu.
